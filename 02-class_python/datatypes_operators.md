### 04 # Python Data Types:
✅ Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type—it’s determined automatically when you assign a value.\
**i) # Built-in Data Types in Python:**
- In programming, a data type is an important concept.
- Variables can store different types of data, and each type allows you to do different kinds of operations.
- Python provides several built-in data types, grouped into categories:

**1. Text Type:**\
**- i) str → String**
```
print("Python is Amazing Programming Language.")
```
**2. Numeric Types:**\
**- i) int → Integer Number**
```
x = 45
y = 55
print(x+y)
```
**- ii) float → Floating point number,  Decimal (floating point) numbers**
```
a = 25.6
b = 1.4
print(a * b)
```
**- iii) Complex → Complex number** 
```
a = 568
b = 54j
print(a, b)
```
**3. Sequence Types:**

**- i) list:** list → Ordered, changeable collection
```
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
y = [24, 34, 44]
print(x)
print(y)
```
**- ii) tuple:** tuple → Ordered, unchangeable collection
```
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)
```
**- iii) range:** range → Sequence of numbers
```
my_range = range(6)
print(my_range)
```
4. Mapping Type

dict

5. Set Types

set

frozenset

6. Boolean Type

bool

7. Binary Types

bytes

bytearray

memoryview

✅ These data types are available in Python by default (no need to import any library).
