### 04 # Python Data Types:
✅ Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type—it’s determined automatically when you assign a value.\
**i) # Built-in Data Types in Python:**
- In programming, a data type is an important concept.
- Variables can store different types of data, and each type allows you to do different kinds of operations.
- Python provides several built-in data types, grouped into categories:

**1. Text Type:**

**- i) str → String**
```
print("Python is Amazing Programming Language.")
```
**2. Numeric Types:**

**- i) int → Integer Number**
```
x = 45
y = 55
print(x+y)
```
**- ii) float → Floating point number,  Decimal (floating point) numbers**
```
a = 25.6
b = 1.4
print(a * b)
```
**- iii) Complex → Complex number** 
```
a = 568
b = 54j
print(a, b)
```
**3. Sequence Types:**

**- i) list:** list → Ordered, changeable collection
```
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
y = [24, 34, 44]
print(x)
print(y)
```
**- ii) tuple:** tuple → Ordered, unchangeable collection
```
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)
```
**- iii) range:** range → Sequence of numbers
```
my_range = range(6)
print(my_range)
```
**4. Mapping Type**

**- dict:** dict → Key-value pairs
```
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person)
```
**5. Set Types**

**- i) set:** set → Unordered, unique values
```
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)
```
**- ii) frozenset:** frozenset → Immutable set
```
my_frozen = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
print(my_frozen)
```
**6. Boolean Type** 

**bool:** bool → True or False
```
a = 10
b = 5
print(a > b)   # True
print(a == b)  # False
```

✅ These data types are available in Python by default (no need to import any library).

### Python Operators:
If you are writing numeric in Python, it's called (integer). And if an integer or float is working with +, -, x, we call them "Operators". Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:\
**Example**
```
print(15+56)  # Addition
print(85-12)  # Subtract
print(458*33) # Multiply
```
**Python groups operators into these categories:**
- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Identity Operators
- Membership Operators
- Bitwise Operators

**Arithmetic Operators**

Used for basic math with numbers:
```
 Operator	   Name	                Example
 +	         Addition	             x + y
 -	        Subtraction	           x - y
 *	       Multiplication	         x * y
 /         	Division	             x / y
 %	     Modulus (remainder)	      x % y
**	     Exponentiation	           x ** y
//	     Floor division            x // y
```
