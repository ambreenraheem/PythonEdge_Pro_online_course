### Python:
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting.

#### Uses of Python:
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping or for production-ready software development.

#### Why Python?
- Cross-platform compatibility: Python works on various platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
- Simple syntax: Its syntax is clear and easy to read, resembling the English language.
- Concise code: Python allows developers to write programs with fewer lines compared to many other programming languages.
- Interpreter-based: Since Python runs on an interpreter system, code can be executed immediately after writing, making prototyping fast and efficient.
- Versatile programming styles: Python supports multiple approachesâ€”procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

#### Python Syntax Compared to Other Programming Languages:
- Readable design: Python was built with readability in mind. Its syntax is close to the English language and is influenced by mathematical notation.
- New line usage: In Python, a new line marks the end of a command, unlike many other languages that require semicolons or parentheses.
- Indentation for scope: Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define the scope of loops, functions, and classes. In contrast, most other languages use curly brackets { } for this purpose.

  
**Example:**
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
