#### ðŸ”¤ What is a string?\
A string is just text inside quotes.
- It can have letters, numbers, or symbols.
- Use single ' or double " quotes.
- Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
```
name = 'ambreen'
greetings = "Hello "
print(greetings,name)
```
Quotes Inside Quotes\
You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
```
print("It's my car.")
print("I am working with 'Ahmed'.")
print('"Tehreem" is my friend.')
```
Multiline Strings\
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes or three single quotes and just print that variable:
```
intro = """Hi, this is ambreen.
I am teaching Python from the basic to the advanced level.
I am a Data Analyst."""
print(intro)
```
```
intro = '''Hi, this is ambreen.
I am teaching Python from the basic to the advanced level.
I am a Data Analyst.'''
print(intro)
```
