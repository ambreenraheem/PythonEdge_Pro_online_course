### Lists in Python
In Python, lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\
They are one of the four built-in data types used to store collections of data â€” the others being Tuple, Set, and Dictionary â€” each with unique features and use cases.\
A list is created by placing items inside square brackets [ ].

**01 # Example:**
```
# Creating a list
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(my_list)
```

**ðŸ”¹ Ordered**\
A list maintains the order of its elements. Each item has a specific index, starting from 0 for the first item, 1 for the second, and so on.\
If you add new items to a list, they are placed at the end.\
Note: Some list methods can change the order, but by default, the original order remains the same.

**ðŸ”¹ Changeable**\
Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation.\
You can add, remove, or change items in a list at any time.

**ðŸ”¹ Allow Duplicates**\
Since lists are indexed, they can contain duplicate values.

**02 # Example:**
```
fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(fruit_list)
```

**ðŸ”¹ List Length**\
To find out how many items are in a list, use the len() function.

**03 # Example:**
```
fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(fruit_list))
```
**ðŸ”¹ List Items â€“ Data Types**\
List elements can be of any data type â€” strings, integers, booleans, etc.

**04 # Examples:**
```
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]      # String list
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]                   # Integer list
list3 = [True, False, False]              # Boolean list
```

You can even mix different data types in a single list:
```
mixed_list = ["hello", 25, True, 5.6]
print(mixed_list)
```
