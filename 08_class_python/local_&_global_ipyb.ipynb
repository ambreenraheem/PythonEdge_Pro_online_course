        "# Global and Local Variables in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables are fundamental in Python for storing and managing data. Their scope (where they can be used) depends on where they are defined. The two main types are local variables and global variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Local Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "A local variable is created inside a function and exists only while that function runs. It cannot be accessed outside the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Example 1: Accessing a Local Variable\n",
        "def greet():\n",
        "    msg = \"Hello from inside the function!\"\n",
        "    print(msg)\n",
        "\n",
        "greet()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "The variable msg is defined inside greet(). It exists only during the function call and is used within the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Example 2: Accessing Local Variable Outside Function (Error)\n",
        "def greet():\n",
        "    msg = \"Hello!\"\n",
        "    print(\"Inside function:\", msg)\n",
        "\n",
        "greet()\n",
        "print(\"Outside function:\", msg)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "msg is local to greet(). It does not exist outside the function, so Python raises a NameError.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Global Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "A global variable is declared outside all functions and can be accessed throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Example: Using a Global Variable\n",
        "msg = \"Python is awesome!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def display():\n",
        "    print(\"Inside function:\", msg)\n",
        "\n",
        "display()\n",
        "print(\"Outside function:\", msg)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "Since msg is global, it is accessible both inside and outside the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scope Rule\n",
        "\n",
        "If Python does not find a variable inside a function (local scope), it searches in the global scope.\n",
        "If a local variable has the same name as a global one, the local variable shadows the global variable inside that function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Local vs Global with Same Name\n",
        "def fun():\n",
        "    s = \"Me too.\"\n",
        "    print(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"I love GeeksforGeeks\"\n",
        "fun()\n",
        "print(s)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "The local variable s inside fun() hides the global s. The global value remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Modifying Global Variables Inside a Function\n",
        "\n",
        "By default, Python does not allow modifying a global variable inside a function unless declared with the global keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Without global (Error)\n",
        "def fun():\n",
        "    s += \" GFG\"\n",
        "    print(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"I love GeeksforGeeks\"\n",
        "fun()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "Python treats s as local because it is modified, but it has not been defined locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# With global (Correct Way)\n",
        "s = \"Python is great!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def fun():\n",
        "    global s\n",
        "    s += \" GFG\"\n",
        "    print(s)\n",
        "    s = \"Look for GeeksforGeeks Python Section\"\n",
        "    print(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "fun()\n",
        "print(s)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\\\n",
        "Declaring global s allows the function to modify the global variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Example: Same Variable Name in Different Scopes\n",
