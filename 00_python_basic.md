## 💻 What is a Computer Language?

A computer language is a way for humans to communicate with a computer.\
Since computers only understand binary (0s and 1s), we use special languages to give them instructions.\

### 🏷️ Types of Computer Languages
**01. Machine Language (Low-level)**
- Written in 0s and 1s (binary).
- Directly understood by the computer.
- Very hard for humans to write.
Example: 10110000 01100001

**02. Assembly Language**
- Uses short codes (mnemonics) instead of 0s and 1s.
- Easier than machine code but still close to hardware.
- Needs an assembler to convert to machine language.
Example:
```
MOV A, 5
ADD A, 2
```

**03. High-Level Language (HLL)**
- Easy to read and write (looks like English).
- Needs a compiler or interpreter to convert into machine code.
- Examples: Python, C, Java, JavaScript.
Example (Python):
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
**📝 In short**
- Computer language = way to talk to computers.
- Low-level (machine & assembly) = fast but hard to learn.
- High-level (Python, Java, etc.) = easy for humans, converted to binary for computers.

## What is a Programming Language and a Scripting Language
**🖥️ Programming Language**
- A programming language is used to write full software or applications.
- It usually needs a compiler to convert code into machine language.
- Often used for big, complex programs (like operating systems, games, applications).
Examples: C, C++, Java

**👉 Think of it like building a big house from scratch.**

**📜 Scripting Language**
- A scripting language is used to write small programs (scripts) that automate tasks.
- It usually runs through an interpreter (line by line, no compilation).
- Often used for automation, web tasks, data analysis.
Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Bash

**👉 Think of it like writing a shortcut or quick tool inside the house.**

| Feature       | Programming Language      | Scripting Language               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Execution | Compiled (before running) | Interpreted (runs line by line)  |
| Usage     | Build big software & apps | Automate tasks, control software |
| Speed     | Faster                    | Slower (but simpler)             |
| Examples  | C, C++, Java              | Python, JavaScript, PHP          |
