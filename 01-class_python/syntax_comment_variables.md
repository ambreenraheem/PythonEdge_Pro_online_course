### Python
**Installation:** For installation, go to the Python official site and click here: https://www.python.org/

### 01 # Syntax:
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
**- Execute Python Syntax**
- As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
**output** Hello, World!

- Or by creating a Python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```

### 02 # Comment:
Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
- Creating a Comment
Comments start with a #, and Python will ignore them:

Example: Get your own Python Server
```
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:\
Example
```
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code; it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

Example
```
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
### 03 # Variable:
Variables are containers for storing data values.

- Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.\
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\
You donâ€™t have to assign a specific type when declaring variables, and their type can change after being assigned.
**Example # 01**
```
x = "Ambreen"
y = 40
z = Karachi
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
**OUTPUT # 01**\
Ambreen\
40\
Karachi

**Example # 02**
```
a = 235
b = 55
c = 5896
# mathematical operation
print(a + b)
print(a * b)
print(c - a)
```
**OUTPUT # 02**\
290\
12925\
5661

**Example # 03**
```
# more presentable:
h = 58
i = 654
j = 258
# again mathematical operation with string
print("This is Addition: ", i + j)
print("This is Multiplication: ", h * i)
```
**OUTPUT # 03**\
This is Addition: 912\
This is Multiplication: 37932
