### Python
**Installation:** For installation, go to the Python official site and click here: https://www.python.org/

### Syntax:
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
**- Execute Python Syntax**
- As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
**output** Hello, World!

- Or by creating a Python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```

### Comment:
Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
- Creating a Comment
Comments start with a #, and Python will ignore them:

Example: Get your own Python Server
```
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:\
Example
```
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code; it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

Example
```
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
